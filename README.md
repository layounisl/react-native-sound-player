# react-native-sound-player

Play audio files, stream audio from URL, using ReactNative.

## Installation

### 1. `yarn` or `npm`

```
    // yarn
    yarn add react-native-sound-player
    // or npm
    npm install --save react-native-sound-player
```

### 2. Link

```
    react-native link react-native-sound-player
```

## Usage

### Play sound with file name and type

1. Add sound files to iOS/Android.

-   On iOS, drag and drop sound file into project in Xcode. Remember to check **"Copy items if needed"** option and **"Add to targets"**.
-   On Android, put sound files in `{project_root}/android/app/src/main/res/raw/`. Just create the folder if it doesn't exist.

2. Import the library and call the `playSoundFile(fileName, fileType)` function:

```javascript
import SoundPlayer from 'react-native-sound-player'

try {
    // play the file tone.mp3
    SoundPlayer.playSoundFile('tone', 'mp3')
    // or play from url
    SoundPlayer.playUrl('https://example.com/music.mp3')
} catch (e) {
    console.log(`cannot play the sound file`, e)
}
```

> Please note that the device can still go to sleep (screen goes off) while audio is playing.
> When this happens, the audio will stop playing.
> To prevent this, you can something like [react-native-keep-awake](https://github.com/corbt/react-native-keep-awake).

### Finished playing/loading event

```javascript
...

// subscribe to the finished playing event in componentDidMount
componentDidMount() {
  SoundPlayer.onFinishedPlaying((success: boolean) => { // success is true when the sound is played
    console.log('finished playing', success)
  })
  SoundPlayer.onFinishedLoading(async (success: boolean) => {
    console.log('finished loading', success)
    // ready to `play()`, `getInfo()`, etc
    console.log(await SoundPlayer.getInfo())
  })
}

// unsubscribe when unmount
componentWillUnmount() {
  SoundPlayer.unmount()
}

...
```

## Functions

### playSound(fileName: string, fileType: string)

Play the sound file named `fileName` with file type `fileType`.

### loadSoundFile(fileName: string, fileType: string)

Load the sound file named `fileName` with file type `fileType`, without playing it.
This is useful when you want to play a large file, which can be slow to mount,
and have precise control on when the sound is played. This can also be used in
combination with `getInfo()` to get audio file `duration` without playing it.
You should subscribe to the `onFinishedLoading` event to get notified when the
file is loaded.

### playUrl(url: string)

Play the audio from url. Supported formats are:

-   [AVPlayer (iOS)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21879981/avfoundation-avplayer-supported-formats-no-vob-or-mpg-containers)
-   [MediaPlayer (Android)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats)

### onFinishedPlaying(callback: (success: boolean) => any)

Subscribe to the "finished playing" event. The `callback` function is called whenever a file is finished playing. **This function will be deprecated soon, please use `addEventListener` below**.

### onFinishedLoading(callback: (success: boolean) => any)

Subscribe to the "finished loading" event. The `callback` function is called whenever a file is finished loading, i.e. the file is ready to be `play()`, `resume()`, `getInfo()`, etc. **This function will be deprecated soon, please use `addEventListener` below**.

### addEventListener(callback: (object: ResultObject) => SubscriptionObject)

Subscribe to any event. Returns a subscription object. Subscriptions created by this function cannot be removed by calling `unmount()`. You **NEED** to call `yourSubscriptionObject.remove()` when you no longer need this event listener or whenever your component unmounts.

Supported events are:

1. `FinishedLoading`
2. `FinishedPlaying`
3. `FinishedLoadingURL`
4. `FinishedLoadingFile`

```javascript
  // Example
  ...
  // Create instance variable(s) to store your subscriptions in your class
  _onFinishedPlayingSubscription = null
  _onFinishedLoadingSubscription = null
  _onFinishedLoadingFileSubscription = null
  _onFinishedLoadingURLSubscription = null

  // Subscribe to event(s) you want when component mounted
  componentDidMount() {
    _onFinishedPlayingSubscription = SoundPlayer.addEventListener('FinishedPlaying', ({ success }) => {
      console.log('finished playing', success)
    })
    _onFinishedLoadingSubscription = SoundPlayer.addEventListener('FinishedLoading', ({ success }) => {
      console.log('finished loading', success)
    })
    _onFinishedLoadingFileSubscription = SoundPlayer.addEventListener('FinishedLoadingFile', ({ success, name, type }) => {
      console.log('finished loading file', success, name, type)
    })
    _onFinishedLoadingURLSubscription = SoundPlayer.addEventListener('FinishedLoadingURL', ({ success, url }) => {
      console.log('finished loading url', success, url)
    })
  }

  // Remove all the subscriptions when component will unmount
  componentWillUnmount() {
    _onFinishedPlayingSubscription.remove()
    _onFinishedLoadingSubscription.remove()
    _onFinishedLoadingURLSubscription.remove()
    _onFinishedLoadingFileSubscription.remove()
  }
  ...
```

### unmount()

Unsubscribe the "finished playing" and "finished loading" event. **This function will be deprecated soon, please use `addEventListener` and remove your own listener by calling `yourSubscriptionObject.remove()`**.

### play()

Play the loaded sound file. This function is the same as `resume()`.

### pause()

Pause the currently playing file.

### resume()

Resume from pause and continue playing the same file. This function is the same as `play()`.

### stop()

Stop playing, call `playSound(fileName: string, fileType: string)` to start playing again.

### setVolume(volume: number)

Set the volume of the current player. This does not change the volume of the device.

### getInfo() => Promise<{currentTime: number, duration: number}>

Get the `currentTime` and `duration` of the currently mounted audio media. This function returns a promise which resolves to an Object containing `currentTime` and `duration` properties.

```javascript
// Example
...
  playSong() {
    try {
      SoundPlayer.playSoundFile('engagementParty', 'm4a')
    } catch (e) {
      alert('Cannot play the file')
      console.log('cannot play the song file', e)
    }
  }

  async getInfo() { // You need the keyword `async`
    try {
      const info = await SoundPlayer.getInfo() // Also, you need to await this because it is async
      console.log('getInfo', info) // {duration: 12.416, currentTime: 7.691}
    } catch (e) {
      console.log('There is no song playing', e)
    }
  }

  onPressPlayButton() {
    this.playSong()
    this.getInfo()
  }

...
```
